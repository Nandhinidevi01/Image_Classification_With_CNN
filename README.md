üß†**Project Title**
Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

üìå **Objective**

  To build a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can accurately classify images into predefined categories. The project aims to demonstrate the power of deep learning in visual data interpretation by training a CNN on a labeled image dataset and evaluating its performance.

üìù **Problem Statement**

  Image classification is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision. Traditional machine learning algorithms often struggle with image data due to high dimensionality and lack of spatial awareness. CNNs overcome this by using convolutional layers to automatically extract spatial hierarchies of features from images.

This project aims to:
  Load and preprocess an image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset).
  Design and train a CNN to learn from the dataset.
  Evaluate the accuracy and performance of the model.
  Use the trained model to predict unseen images.

üí° **Why CNN?**

  CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that are particularly effective for processing grid-like data, such as images. They automatically detect important features like edges, textures, and shapes, making them more suitable than traditional fully connected networks for image tasks.

üìÇ **Dataset**

You can use any of the following:
  üñºÔ∏è Common Datasets:
      CIFAR-10: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
      MNIST: 70,000 handwritten digits (0‚Äì9), grayscale images.
      Fashion-MNIST: Images of clothing types.
      Or a custom dataset with folders of images categorized by class labels.

üîß**Tools and Technologies**

  Language: Python
  Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
  IDE: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
  Environment: Local system or Google Colab (GPU acceleration)

üîÅ **Workflow / Steps Involved**

  Data Collection
  Download or prepare the dataset.
  Organize images in folders by class (if custom).
  Data Preprocessing
  Resize images to a uniform size.
  Normalize pixel values.
  One-hot encode labels (if needed).
  Split into training and testing datasets.
  Model Building
  Define a CNN architecture using Keras or PyTorch.
  Use layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.
  Training
Compile the model with loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy), optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Train using model.fit() or similar.
Evaluation
Test the model on the validation/test dataset.
Plot loss/accuracy curves using Matplotlib.
Generate a confusion matrix.
Prediction
Load new images and predict their class using the trained model.
Saving & Loading Model
Save the trained model (.h5, .pt, or .pkl).
Load and reuse the model for predictions.
